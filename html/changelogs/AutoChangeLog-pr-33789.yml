changes:
  - tweak: Can now use grabs to put mobs in sleepers. This is already existing behavior
      for cryopods and bodyscanners.
  - tweak: Can no longer put a mob in a sleeper/cryotube/cryopod/body scanners if
      they are being grabbed by someone other than you.
  - tweak: Added eject verb to sleeper. Remember, you can use Alt+Click to eject people
      from sleepers.
  - bugfix: Fixed bug where a mob could not be buckled if mob was grabbing itself.
  - bugfix: Grabs and pulls now properly release when you put a mob in a sleeper,
      cryopod, body scanner, or cryotube
